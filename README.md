# CoViD Tracker Vision Statement

## Problem

There's a lack of easy 'on-demand' access to sorted data surrounding the Coronavirus Disease 19 and correlated data. 

## Proposed Software Solution

Getting the latest data should be as simple as clicking an icon or issuing a simple command, like so: 

```
$ covid_tracker
```

Moreover, you should be able to get vital information, arranged in a way that makes sense, like so:

It should also be in a language that is available by default \(or easily obtained\) in practically any computing environment one might find themselves in; Python
